                <div class="summary">
                    <p><strong>Andrew James Potter</strong> I majored in Physics. I have worked as a developer and in particular as a Ruby-on-Rails developer. My main interest is education and I like to teach others the knowledge I have learnt myself. I have also tutored Mathematics privately. I also excel with technology. When I was 14 I emailed Nintendo asking what I needed to learn to make games. So from an early age I developed a strong interest in technology and began by learning the C++ programming language at approximately the age of 14 and learning GNU/Linux from the age of 15. I love pentesting with Kali Linux and Metasploit (ethical hacking). I am also fascinated by digital art creation in 3d and 2d and the application of Physics and Mathematics to create interactive art like videogames and simulations. I eventually developed a love for the Ruby programming language and in particular Ruby-on-Rails. I have developed a 3d Map App using Unity3d for iOS/Android/OSX/Windows 10. I discovered three confirmed bugs in Unity3d, which I was rewarded for by Unity.  I am an active member of both the Ruby and the Elixir meetup in Cambridge, which I am in the process of reviving and organising meetups. I have coached minority groups how to code. I am working on a community scaffolding project which has a focus on education and free courses called dinarly.</p>

Reference for Andrew Potter.<br><br>Andrew has worked with us for four years now, joining us part time initially and working up to a 0.8 contract latterly. Andrew is a conscientious, willing, polite and cooperative member of our IT support team. He is keen to learn new skills as well as practising his well developed programming skills. He has been responsible for IT support in our fully wireless BYOD environment and has shown himself to be responsive, adaptable and effective in resolving a whole range of issues, such as administering the VLE and VLE outreach, fixing students laptops and problem solving computer and projector issues around the site. He has trained teachers in the use of the VLE. He communicates well with a variety of audiences and has shown himself to be persistent and determined in addressing the concerns of our users. Andrew has used his programming skills to good effect and has designed and built a Ruby-on-Rails (version 5) WebGL 3d Map App of the school which is published on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/YateleySchool/YSMap3d-Rails">https://github.com/YateleySchool/YSMap3d-Rails</a>. He also designed and built a Ruby-on-Rails (version 4) Work Experience database system, which helped our work experience manager immensely. I can recommend Andrew to you without reservation.<br><br>Kind regards,<br>Mark Jackman<br>Headteacher<br>Yateley School</p>
